<br><b>Controller Layout</b></br>
   The arcade machine will have **2 player controller** layouts each with a joystick and 8 buttons for your game. 

  
<br>Real-time, two-player, cooperative retro puzzle game.<br>
<b>GOAL:</b> Get one player token to move into the goal tile in less then the level's move limit.<br>
Earn extra points for each turn under the turnlimit for the level.<br>
At the same time, each player uses joystick to move his or her token up, down, left or right. <br>
Once a token is set in motion, it continues until it hits a wall or another token.<br>
Each time a token moves, regargless of how far it moves, counts as one move.<br>




#The basic idea is a real-time retro puzzle game where enemies shoot and move at the player in continuous space. The player has only one life. The player moves by teleporting in discrete space, perhaps, we are thinking, as the chess knight (one of 8 spaces).
#
#The objective is for the player to get to the goal space before being killed.
#
#Obstacles include walls, moving walls, portals (that walls, bullets and enemies, and the player passes through).
#
#Some levels might require luring an enemy to a location where moving on a lever could trap the enemy, then, after the player makes some other moves, that enemy needs to be released so the trap can be used for a different enemy.
#
#With all movement limited to a knight, simply being placed in a maze with a very clear cardinal direction solution could be quite tricky with the solution path quite different from the obvious one.
#
#Have not yet decided on board size. Joel is thinking that 8x8 is the max, but thinks very interesting puzzles might fit on a 6x6.
