    <description> Bokkusu is a real-time, single player or cooperative 
            puzzle game wherein the goal is to maneuver either the red or 
            blue block to the spinning portal sphere in the fewest 
            moves. Once a block is set in motion, it continues in a straight 
            line until it hits a wall or some other object. A powerful 
            mechanic is move both player blocks at the same time so that 
            they collide and stop in a desired location. Some blocks, 
            crates, can be smashed through with a high speed collision.
