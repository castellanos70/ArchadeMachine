            Bokkusu is a real-time, single or two player puzzle game wherein 
            the goal is to maneuver your block to the spinning portal sphere 
            in as few moves a possible (solo) or before your opponent 
            (two player). Once a block is set in motion, it continues in a 
            straight line until it hits a wall or some other object. 
            Either player can drop a crate by pressing button (1) or (4).  
            Crates can be smashed through with a high speed collision.
